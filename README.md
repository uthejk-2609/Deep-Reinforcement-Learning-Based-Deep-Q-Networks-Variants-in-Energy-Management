# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Deep-Q-Networks-Variants-in-Energy-Management

In today's energy-conscious world, efficient energy management has become a critical challenge. Buildings, being one of the major energy consumers usages of light source, humidity control irrespective to surrounding environment conditions and presence of human, this requires innovative solutions to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs. This study presents a unique energy management system for room optimization that makes use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches notably Q-Learning, domain of dynamic decision making of DRL agent with the environment interaction. Deep Reinforcement Learning extends the principles of RL by incorporating deep neural networks to learn optimal behaviors.The proposed study uses variations of DQN algorithms, such as Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), Dueling Q-Network (Dueling DQN) and its hyperparameter tuning. This study includes a comparative analysis of the three algorithms and an evaluation of their performance. This comparative analysis contributes valuable insights, providing a viable resolution to the problems associated with modern building energy management and cost efficiency in which Dueling DQN has contributed a significant performance.
